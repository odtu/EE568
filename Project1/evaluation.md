## Project Guideline

### Rules:

- All projects will be submitted through GitHub, no emails will get accepted by email, print-out etc.
- No submissions will be accepted after the deadline.
- Reports will be checked using Turnitin, and copying will not be tolerated.

### Procedure:

#### Q-1:

In the analytical part, hand written homeworks are accepted (just for this assignment), but I stronlgy encourage you to use reproducable computer tools, such as MATLAB, R, Jupyter Notebook etc.

Please include the datasheets of the materials you used. Explain any assumptions you made.

In the FEA simulations please make sure, your images are clear and contains legible legend, and other information. As I mentioned earlier, 2D simulations are enough but you can do 3D analysis if you want.

#### Q-2:

For this part, NO hand-written documents will be accepted. The easiest design tool you can build is Microsoft Excel, where you can change the design inputs easily and see their effects. If you decide to use Microsoft Excel, please highlight any important design input by Yellow, and highlight any major design outpu by Green for easy evaluation. Please define each parameter in the design sheet clearly. You are allowed to use other tools such as MATLAB, but please include the source code (with proper variable names), and prepare your code easy to read.

You are required to prepare a design report that summarizes all the important parameters of your design and your design method. Please discuss how  parameters (such as number of turns, material properties, core geometry etc) to effect the transpormer design.
 
## Evaluation

The project will be evaluated using the following guideline:

**Number of Commits:15%:** The number of edits of your project files as seen from the contributors list. For example, if you start making your project in the last few days, you’ll get no credit. If you start early and continue editing your files, you’ll get full credit. The projects are time consuming, so this is a way to encourage you to start early and work regularly. Note that, each student will be evaluated separately according to personal commit number.

**Report Quality:15%:** Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section.

**Technical Level:70%:** The detail level of your simulations and your conclusions.

## Number of Commits:

In this project the minimum expected number of commits on different days is 3. Each days you made at least one commit is 3 points (saturating at 9 points).  The following rules apply:

- Your commit has to be a meaningful, and considerable amount of change has to be made compared to the previous version. For example, just changing a few words in your report is not a meaningful commit.

- Number of days that you committed will be evaluated by common sense. For example, a commit at 23:58 and another commit at 00:02 will still count as one.

- Do not try to find a workaround. Just spend time on your project, and improve your models regularly and it should be fine.

You'll get 6 points from the content of your commit messages. You are supposed to write clear and explanatory commit messages, listing what  specific improvements that you made in that version. Please have a look at the following links:

## Report Quality:

You report quality will be evaluated using the following criteria:

- The report has a separate title page (2pts)
- The report has an introduction section that briefly explains the content and the aims of the report (2pts)
- The report organized properly with clear sections and subsections (2pts)
- All figures and tables have proper captions (3pts)
- The graphs have proper axes labels and font size of labels is adequate (3pts)
- No grammar/spelling errors and very well-written report (hint: use spell-check) (3pts)

## Technical Level:

Following grades will be applied for each part:

- Q1: Part A) 15 pts
- Q1: Part B) 25 pts
- Q1: Part C) 5 pts

- Q2: 25 pts
