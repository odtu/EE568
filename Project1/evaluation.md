## Project Guideline

### Rules:

- All projects files will be made available in your GitHub accounts, and the reports to be uploaded to ODTUClass.
- Any reports sent by email, or thrown under my door will not be accepted.
- No submissions will be accepted after the deadline.
- Reports will be checked using Turnitin, and copying will not be tolerated.
- No hand written reports will be accepted.

### Report Quality Check:

An initial check will be made after you submit. If any of the requirements is not satisfied, then you will be given 3-days to update your report, but with a %15 penalty.

- The report has a separate title page
- The report has an introduction section that briefly explains the content and the aims of the report
- The report organized properly with clear sections and subsections
- All figures and tables have proper captions
- The graphs have proper axes labels and legends. The font size is adequate
- Minimum grammar or spelling mistakes (hint: use spell-check)
- Graphs have enough resolution, no full screen-shots.

### Procedure:

I advise you to use proper tools, such as LaTeX, MATLAB reports, Jupyter Notebooks, but you can use Word if you wish. 

If you built your analytical model in a code environment, please make sure you have a readable and well documented code.

Include the material properties of the material you choose in the appendix section of your report.

## Evaluation

The project will be evaluated using the following guideline:

**Number of Commits:15%:** I expect you have at least three commits on different days. Please have a meaningful commit message.  If you start early and continue editing your files, youâ€™ll get full credit. The projects are time consuming, so this is a way to encourage you to start early and work regularly. 

**Technical Level:85%:** The level of detail of your simulations. Please give extra attention to your discussions and comparison sections. Please state any assumptions you make and discuss any discrepancies  between different types of simulations.
